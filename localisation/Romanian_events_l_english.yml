By early 1938, negotiations for establishing a factory for the production of R35 tanks had reached an advanced stage. By this time France's own demands for rearmament prohibited further development.\n\nIn August and September 1939, as a stopgap measure, forty-one R 35s were supplied to the Royal Romanian Army. These tanks served as the principal tank of the newly-formed 2nd Armoured Regiment. At the end of September 1939, an additional thirty-four brand new R 35s passed into Romanian hands when the Polish 21st Light Tank Battalion (Batalion Czolgów Lekkich,or BCL) chose internment over capture following the German conquest of Poland. With seventy-five tanks on strength, the 2nd Armoured Regiment expanded to two battalions."

 romania.21.t:0 "Romanian Army Reorganized"
 romania.21.d:0 "The disastrous situation of the country also made its mark on Romania's army. Numerous voices raised in protest against the cowardly approach of Romanian authorities related to territorial cessions, while there was an army ready and willing to fight.\n\nLt. General Ion Antonescu (he had been promoted on September 16th 1940) realized he had to act quickly. He promptly retired 80 superior officers, considered incompetent or men of the former regime, with another 84 soon following.\n\nHe also began a reorganization of the army according to German military doctrine, and adopted an increasingly harsher attitude towards the legionnaire propaganda in the army, forbidding the officers and NCOs to get involved in politics. The swift measures taken by a military mind halted the decline of both army morale and organization. But more needed to be done to help it recover its prestige."

 romania.22.t:0 "Odessa has fallen!"
 romania.22.d:0 "On 27 July 1941, Hitler sent a letter to General Antonescu in which he requested further cooperation of Romanian troops beyond the Dniester River, and granted the Romanians administration of the territory between the Dniester and the Bug rivers. Antonescu accepted on 31 July. In fact the Romanian Third Army had already crossed the Dnester on 17 July.\n\nThe Siege of Odessa was part of the Eastern Front area of operations and was primarily conducted by Romanian forces and elements of the German Army's 11th Army. Due to the heavy resistance of the Soviet 9th Independent Army and the rapidly formed Separate Coastal Army, which consisted of the Coastal Group of the 9th Army and the Black Sea Fleet forces in Odessa, it took the Romanian army 73 days of siege and four attempts to take the city, during which they suffered 93,000 casualties."

 romania.23.d:0 "The IAR 80 is a low-wing, monoplane, all-metal construction fighter aircraft. In 1930 the Romanian government issued specifications for a new fighter. Although the government did not expect bids from its own aircraft industry, IAR company produced several prototype fighters in response to the tender. \n\nNone of the other Romanian companies entered a bid, and as the industry was rife with corruption, the government nationalized IAR while the other two companies were left to their own devices.\n\nThe IAR80 prototype has an open cockpit and it's using a 870 HP IAR K14-III C32 engine, which is a licensed Gnome-Rhône 14K II Mistral Major.\n\nThe model can be improved if we accept to fund the project."

 romania.24.d:0 "The IAR 80 prototype was completed slowly, and first took to the air in April of 1939. Test flights of the prototype were impressive. The aircraft could reach 510 km/h at 4,000 m, service ceiling of 11,000 m with the ability to climb to 5,000 m in 6 minutes which was respectable at the time, though not up to the contemporary Supermarine Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters.\n\nThe IAR.80 proved to be highly maneuverable and, generally, a delight to fly. The ARR was impressed and ordered 100 of the new fighters on 18 December 1939, while orders for additional German He 112s beyond the original 30 were cancelled."

 romania.25.d:0 "Having accomplished the wishes of unity and independence by the end of World War I, Romania and Poland were interested in building relationships of friendship and cooperation between them in order to defend national sovereignty. Polish-Romanian political relations were initiated on 3 March 1921 by a treaty of friendship and cooperation that both countries pledged To provide mutual help in case one of them would be attacked, without provocation, on their part on their common borders in the east."\n\nOnce one of the Contracting States would be attacked, in terms of constituting a casus foederis,in accordance with provisions established between the two states, the co-signing State shall have the obligation to enact immediate mobilization as well. Between 1921 and 1931 there were numerous meetings to establish the concrete modalities of action of the Polish-Romanian forces to repel an attack from the east."

 romania.26.t:0 "Economic Agreement with Germany"
 romania.26.d:0 "After Titulescu's removal, an improvement in the relationship with Germany was necessary due to it's significant rise of power while French influence was constantly fading.\n\nThe Pro-German policy of Romania’s allies, Poland and Yugoslavia, was another reason for this new orientation. Romania’s economic relation with Germany was very much in Romania’s favour. It provided a market for its agricultural products, a source of advanced technology that allowed a modernization of industry, and an alternative armament supplier.\n\nThe economic agreement of December 1937 that led to an enhancement of economic trade showed the important place that Germany had gained in the Romanian economy."

 romania.27.t:0 "Germany takes over Austrian businesses"
 romania.27.d:0 "The Anschluss conferred on the Reich the economic domination and a strategic position in Central and South-Eastern Europe. Germany took over all the Austrian businesses in Romania.\n\nThe 1934 German economic strategy, the Schacht Plan, introducing a new currency-control regime and German bilateral economic relations with the countries producing raw materials based on compensation arrangements, would soon be replaced by a New Plan, stipulating the concept of multilateral trade agreements and allowing the exchange of goods with countries with complementary economies.\n\nThe advantage for Romania would be that the New Plan was to provide a market for exported products at higher prices than those prevailing on world markets. And Romanian food products were to be exchanged for German industrial goods."

 romania.28.t:0 "Titulescu Removed"
 romania.28.d:0 "In June 1936, Foreign Affairs Minister Nicolae Titulescu famously reacted to the buffoonery exhibited by the Italian journalists when Emperor Haile Selassie I spoke to the League after Ethiopia had been invaded and occupied by Fascist Italy. He jumped to his feet and shouted: A la porte les sauvages!\n\nLater in 1936, under pro-Nazi parties pressure, King Carol II removed Titulescu from all official positions, asking him to leave the country.\nSettling first in Switzerland, he later moved to France.\n\nWhile in exile, Nicolae Titulescu continued through conferences and newspaper articles to propagate the idea of the preservation of peace, perceiving the danger of a war that was to come all too soon after. He returned to Romania in November 1937, partly through the efforts of Iuliu Maniu."

 romania.29.t:0 "Octavian Goga forms a Government"
 romania.29.d:0 "After the elections, King Carol II used the pretext that no party was able to get a majority of 40%, and nominated Octavian Goga, the president of the National-Christian Party, as Prime Minister, asking him to form a government, although his party received less than 10% of the votes. This was only the first step in the royal dictatorship.\n\nIn doing so, the king placed several hits to the PNT party and its leader, Iuliu Maniu. PNT was to be removed from its succession, although it did receive double the amount of PNC's votes, the head of the government was to be an old, determined political adversary of Maniu, and several key members of PNT were to be lured to the king's side, including the newly appointed Minister of Interior, Armand Calinescu."

 romania.30.d:0 "The beginning of 1938 faced a rise of the Iron Guard, which was fiercely attacking the regime ruling the country in order to shift Romania's foreign policy towards the Berlin - Rome Axis.\nMoreover, Prime-minister Goga wanted to win the elections in March 1938 and therefore negotiated a secret agreement with Corneliu Codreanu. Democratic forces were confused and confusing, which enabled Carol II to intervene decisively and achieve his political objective.\n\nBy the coup of February 10, 1938, Carol dismissed Goga of the Council of Ministers and triggered the creation of a government headed by Patriarch Miron Cristea.\nThe 1923 Constitution was suspended and a new fundamental law was hastly developed and promulgated on February 27, 1938, giving the king broad executive and legislative powers.\n\nBy these acts, the monarchy ensured its dominance over the country's political scene, subordinating state institutions to Carol II's will."

 romania.31.t:0 "Suppression of the Legionary"
 romania.31.d:0 "Availing itself of the uncertain internal political climate as well as of the favourable international support of Germany and Italy, the Iron Guard increased it's pressure upon Romanian authorities through large scale public manifestations.\n\nFurthermore, on November 24th, 1938 during an official visit to Berlin, King Carol II was bluntly approached by Hitler relating to the immediate release from prison of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, and to the Romanian alignment to Axis international policies.\n\nThe King perceived the Legionary Movement as a threat, then more than ever, and as a result, during the night of 29-30 November 1938, Codreanu and 13 others were killed while allegedly trying to escape from prison. A systematic campaign of the authorities for the dismantling of the Legion was initiated."
 romania.31.a:0 "Their radicalism is a threat."
 romania.32.t:0 "Storm Clouds Gather"
 romania.32.d:0 "With their new orientation in foreign policy towards Germany, Romanian politicians cherished the illusion that Romania could secure Berlin's support for defending the territorial integrity of the country.\nSuch hopes would soon be proven not only illusory, but also dangerous for the country's future.\n\nThe German government's response, handed by Ambassador W. Fabricius on June 2nd, 1940, meant a terrible disappointment for the Romanian government circles.\n\nIt clearly showed that Nazi Germany was not interested in maintaining Romania's territorial status-quo and unwilling to take commitments in this regard. Any close "friendly cooperation" with Romania was conditioned by its willingness to act on a definitive settlement of the Balkan sphere.\n\nThe issue whether and to what extent the Romanian government is willing to negotiate a border revision request of its neighbors was now openly approached by the Reich."

Calinescu continued the traditional Romanian policy of close relations with France and the United Kingdom and was to be the one to allow the Polish government, army and refugees to seek shelter on Romanian soil, much against Germany's protests."

 romania.34.t:0 "Warsaw Falls, Romania Isolated"
 romania.34.d:0 "The occupation of Poland brought about the dissolution of the Romanian alliance system and left the Romanians into a state of deeper isolation on the international stage. Although on September 7 Romania declared its neutrality in the conflict, it did allow passage of war materials aimed to reinforce Polish positions, and on September 13, the Polish National Treasury, estimated at about 45 million dollars, also received clearance to transit Romanian soil on its way towards France.\n\nTogether with the Treasury, about 50,000 Poles have gone to Romania to save their lives and seek refuge from which to resume the fight for homeland defense. Furthermore, on September 17, the Polish Government sought refuge in Romania as well. Acknowledging the futility of the defensive-alliance clause, the Poles released Romania of its obligation to declare war on the Soviet Union, which was already advancing deep in Polish territory."

France supported the alliance by signing treaties with each member country.\n\nIt was thus stated that in the event of an unprovoked attack employed by Hungary against a certain stipulator other parties should provide mutual assistance. In addition, the treaties defined the mutual assistance via a special military convention which was to be signed.\nUntil such a convention came into force, interim measures were to be taken.

 romania.36.d:0 "In 1938 the Czechoslovakian crisis broke. As it was clear that Great Britain's and France's reaction was far too weak and no substantial military support would be given to Czechoslovakia, Romania was also reluctant to grant support to its ally, in order to avoid a potential war with Germany. As a member of the Little Entente, Romania and Yugoslavia were compelled to offer military support to Czechoslovakia in case of a Hungarian attack but not in case of a German one.\n\nThe Munich Agreement of September 30th, 1938 made Romania once again conclude that it should not count on Western support and convinced it of the necessity of maintaining neutrality between the Great Powers. Also, the Munich Treaty enhanced the economic influence of Germany over the countries in Central and South-Eastern Europe. In Romania, Germany took over all the Czechoslovakian investments and became the main armament supplier."

The next day Prime Minister Tatarescu informed the German representative, Wilhelm Fabricius, that Romania "aims to broaden friendly cooperation" in the future with the Nazi Reich.\n\nThus, on 28 May 1940, during an extended audience granted by King Carol II to the main members of the Council of Ministers, the abandonment of former external orientation promoted by Romania was discussed and recommended, in favor of a policy of "adapting to reality", primarily oriented toward Germany. Discussions on 28 May 1940 resulted, in a practical manner, in a permanent loss of Romania's neutrality."

Fabricius on June 2nd, 1940, meant a terrible disappointment for the Romanian government circles.\n\nIt clearly showed that Nazi Germany was not interested in maintaining Romania's territorial status-quo and unwilling to take commitments in this regard. Any close friendly cooperation" with Romania was conditioned by its willingness "to act on a definitive settlement of the Balkan sphere". The issue "whether and to what extent the Romanian government is willing to negotiate a border revision request of its neighbors" was now openly approached by the Reich."

This armament suite was clearly not heavy enough for combat use, and the production model was supposed to mount six of these guns.\n\nThe German invasion of Belgium and the Low Countries in 1940 ended the supply of the FN guns, and there was no indigenous machine gun that was suitable for use in aircraft. It wasn't until November 1940 when Romania joined the Axis that the Germans eventually allowed the delivery of the guns to resume.

This attitude generated a division in the Little Entente. Romanian refusal was also due to the fact that the treaty would have given the USSR the right to cross its territory in order to help Czechoslovakia.

The inverted "V" Engine was continuously developed by the Germans and offers up to 1775HP. It is produced in large numbers so the problem of availability should be put to an end this way.\nThe engineers from IAR Brasov have tested a variant of IAR 80 by changing the outdaded IAR K14 radial engine with the DB 605. Because of the injection system the flying charachteristics are greatly imrpoved allowing the plane to accelerate and climb much faster. This feature means that the fuel will be burnt faster resulting in very good performances but a smaller range.\n\nThere is also the Gnome-Rhone 14R radial engine with similar performances compared to the DB 605.
