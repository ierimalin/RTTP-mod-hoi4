 rom.30.desc:0 "Every four years, all the Senate and Chamber of Deputies seats are up for election. While often overshadowed by world events, the local situation in each constituency can sometimes make the difference. \n\nAfter all the votes were counted, the faction in support of the Government [ROM.GetSenateElectionOutcome] in the Senate and [ROM.GetHouseElectionOutcome] in the Chamber."
 rom.30.a:0 "The people have spoken."

 rom.31.t:0 "A Shift in the Political Landscape"
 rom.31.desc:0 "With a new Head of Government, the former opposition in Parliament has largely shifted to support the new administration. [ROM.GetLeader] can count on the support of [?Senators_support] Senators and [?representatives_support] Deputies."
 rom.31.a:0 "The people have spoken."
 rom_congress_elections_tt_bad:0 "In the parliamentary elections, the faction supporting the Government will face stronger opposition.\n"
 rom_congress_elections_tt_good:0 "The momentum gained from the electoral campaign is likely to carry over to the parliamentary elections.\n"
 rom.32.t:0 "Government Faction wins Majority in Parliament"
 rom.32.desc:0 "It appears that the reforms of the electoral system we instituted have been most successful, as a large number of our supporters were elected to Parliament in the last election. With a solid majority, we should have little trouble pushing through our political agenda."
 rom.32.a:0 "A clear sign of our support in the population."
 rom.33.t:0 "Legionaries Win Majority in Parliament"
 rom.33.desc:0 "It has never been throughout our history such a strong movement such as Garda de Fier is. The legionaries won the majority in the Parliament in fair organised elections. As long as we have the people the will and the hearts to build, nothing can  stop us."
 rom.33.a:0 "Make Romania Great Again!"
 rom.40.t:0 "Senator votes for Government Proposal"
 rom.40.desc:0 "In a recent vote, a Senator has suprisingly switched sides to vote for a Government proposal. While the issue itself was fairly minor, the public vote of support from a previously outspoken critic of [ROM.GetLeader] has raised many eyebrows around Bucharest.\n\nSome analysts believe that this example will lead additional Senators to reconsider their stance."
 rom.40.a:0 "A useful ally."
 rom.41.t:0 "Deputy speaks passionately in support of Government"
 rom.41.desc:0 "Asked about his stance on a number of policy issues at a fund-raising dinner, a Deputy spoke out in support of [ROM.GetLeader]'s policies. He further claimed that many of his fellow desputies had similar views, but were merely held back by "idiotic short-sightedness, thinking no further than the next election" instead of doing what was right for the Romanian people. \n\nHis comments have been widely reported by the press and put several of his colleagues in hot water as they had to explain where they stood on these issues."
 rom.41.a:0 "He is right, you know."
 rom.42.t:0 "Senator speaks out against Government Policy"
 rom.42.desc:0 "A Senator has given an interview in a major newspaper, saying that he can no longer support the "foolish and dangerous" policies of [ROM.GetLeader]. He further claimed that he knew several other Senators who thought similarly and would abandon the Head of State in short order."
 rom.42.a:0 "He'll come running back soon enough."
 rom.43.t:0 "Deputy criticizes [ROM.GetLeader]"
 rom.43.desc:0 "During a recent debatte on tax reform, a Deputy launched into a long-winded speech about the many failings of the Government. According to him, no right-thinking Romanian could possibly want to support the policies of the Government, whatever their party affiliation may be. \n\nHis harsh words seem to have had an effect, as a number of Deputies previously thought firmly behind the policies of [ROM.GetLeader] made noises of support."
 rom.43.a:0 "Disgraceful."
 rom.44.t:0 "Opposition suffers defeat in the Senate"
 rom.44.desc:0 "A motion to censure The Government of [ROM.GetLeader] has been defeated in the Senate. While even its most ardent supporters had little hope that it would pass, the amount of votes against it came as a shock even to the most pessimistic of observers. It appears that the President enjoys a far greater level of support in the Senate than most believed, which should help in advancing his legislative agenda."
 rom.44.a:0 "Great."
 rom.45.t:0 "Chamber Committee supports the Government Policy"
 rom.45.desc:0 "The latest round of hearings in the Chamber Committee on Ways and Means has resulted in a report crediting [ROM.GetLeader]'s policies with a major improvements in all available metrics of the economy. While stopping short of outright praise, the report nevertheless comes as a blow to those that were critisizing the Government and demanding reforms.\n\nA number of Deputies have already publically declared that although they still harbour doubts about the Government's agenda, they will now vote in support."
 rom.45.a:0 "As well they should."
 rom.46.t:0 "Senator retires"
 rom.46.desc:0 "Following a minor heart attack, a senior Senator announced today that he will be retiring for health reasons. With more than two decades in the Parliament, the Senator built a large network of supporters and his influence carried a lot of weight. While technically only one man with one vote, Bucharest insiders nonetheless counted him as worth several votes as he was the key to secure several others. \n\nWith the seat most likely going to an avowed critic of [ROM.GetLeader], the Administration will find it a lot harder to secure the necessary votes to pass bills."
 rom.46.a:0 "He will be missed. And his vote as well."
 rom.47.t:0 "Chamber hearings into Governmental misconduct"
 rom.47.desc:0 "A minor scandal originating in the Victory Palace has started to gain momentum. Following weeks of media reports implying that a minor administrative official had been taking bribes in return for lucrative Government contracts, the Chamber Committe on Expenditures in the Executive has begun to hold hearings to determine if the Head of the Government was aware of this. While most observers don't believe that this will lead to any major trouble for [ROM.GetLeader], it will no doubt mean that many of the [ROM.GetLeader]'s supporters will have to lay low for a while."
 rom.47.a:0 "A witchhunt."
 rom.61.t:0 "Senator from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] offers Support"
 rom.61.desc:0 "The senior Senator from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] has approached the Government with an offer of support. His state suffers from critical under-investment, and a Government-initiated economic stimulus program would certainly make him reconsider his stance on certain proposed Government policies. The Senator sits on several important committees, and is quite famous for being able to cut deals, making his vote worth several more in both chambers."
 rom.61.a:0 "It is a very underdeveloped region."
 rom.61.b:0 "This smells of corruption."
 rom.62.desc:0 "The Senators from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] have approached the Government, offering their support for the President in return for an informal guarantee that [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] would be the site of a new munitions plant for the Army. They argue that building a plant in the area would create a lot of jobs and provide the Army with much needed support in an increasingly dangerous world. The two Senators also mentioned their excellent working relationship with several influential members of the Parliament."
 rom.62.a:0 "They make a lot of good points."
 rom.62.b:0 "These kinds of deals are below my atributions."
 rom.63.t:0 "Deputies from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] offer Support"
 rom.63.desc:0 "The parliamentary Delegation from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] have approached the Government with several suggestions to improve the infrastructure of the state. Government funding should be made available to upgrade roads and bridges in order to promote commerce between the regions. They also noted that support from the Government in this would certainly make them more inclined to support the Government more directly in its agenda."
 rom.63.a:0 "A commendable initiative."
 rom.63.b:0 "Let them try to push that through by themselves."
 rom.64.t:0 "Senate Committee investigates shipbuilding in [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName]"
 rom.64.desc:0 "Prodded by the senior Senator from [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName], the Senate Commerce Committee has begun hearings into the state of the local shipbuilding industry. According to experts, a significant percentage of Romania's trade depends on overseas trade, and the country is desperately lacking in shipbuilding capacity. [ROM_congress_investment_state.GetName] has been identified as a region in which a major investment should be made, and several committee members have expressed an expectation that the Government of [ROM.GetLeader] will set funds aside for this."
 rom.64.a:0 "A critical weakness."
 rom.64.b:0 "We have bigger problems."
