 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:"The position of Romania in the inter-war period proved to be of vital strategic interest to the major powers of Europe. The country's oil reserves and cereals, and its location at the crossroads of south-eastern Europe, represented a powerful magnet for any power with ambitions of territorial expansion in the area. \n\nThus in the late 1930s control of Romanian oil, invaluable for the German war machine, became the object of German policy."
